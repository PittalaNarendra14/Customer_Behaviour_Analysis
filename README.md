## 📊 Dataset
- Total Records: ~3,900 transactions  
- Features include:
  - Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status)
  - Purchase details (Item, Category, Amount, Season, Size, Color)
  - Shopping behavior (Discount Applied, Frequency, Review Rating, Shipping Type)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Data cleaning & EDA  
- **SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)** – Data analysis  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard  
- **Excel** – Dataset storage  
- **Gamma (PPT)** – Presentation creation

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Cleaning (Python)
- Imported dataset using pandas  
- Handled missing values (Review Ratings)  
- Renamed columns for consistency  
- Performed feature engineering (age groups, purchase frequency)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distributions and trends  
- Identified patterns in customer behavior  
- Checked relationships between variables  

### 3. SQL Analysis
Performed business-focused queries such as:
- Revenue by gender  
- Top-rated products  
- Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)  
- Discount impact on purchases  
- Subscription behavior analysis  

### 4. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
- Built an interactive dashboard  
- Visualized sales, revenue, and customer insights  
- Enabled filtering by category and customer attributes  

### 5. Reporting & Presentation
- Created a detailed project report  
- Designed a presentation using Gamma for storytelling
